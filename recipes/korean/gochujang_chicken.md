## Ingredients

makes two servings

### Chicken

- 4 boneless skinless chicken thighs, diced
- ½ red onion, chopped
- ¼ cup cornstarch
- ¼ cup neutral oil

### Sauce

- ½ tbsp garlic, minced
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 2 tsp sesame seeds
- 2 tbsp Gochujang
- ¾ tsp sesame oil
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp cornstarch
- 1 cup water

### Serving

- 200g rice, boiled
- 1 stalk green onion, sliced
- 1 tsp sesame seeds

## Preparations

**0:** Mise en place (chop thighs, chop onion, mince garlic, slice onion, boil rice).

**1:** In a small bowl, whisk together your cornstarch and water into a cornstarch slurry.

**2:** Mix the diced chicken thighs in a bowl with the cornstarch until coated. Ensure the thighs are moist so the cornstarch sticks.

**3:** Heat neutral oil in a large pan or wok. Once the oil is hot and glistening, carefully lower the coated chicken and fry until golden and crispy ~10 minutes.

**4:** Transfer the chicken to a plate. Increase the heat to high. Add onion to the residual oil and fry until aromatic.

**5:** Add the sauce ingredients except the slurry. Mix well (break apart the gochujang). Add the cornstarch slurry, reduce and simmer until thick and glossy.

**6:** Mix the chicken into the pan with the sauce. Once fully covered, remove and serve over rice. Garnish with sesame seeds and green onions.
