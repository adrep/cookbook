## Notes

- Make sure to use Arborio (risotto) rice, most rice types will not work.
- Instead of a shallot, feel free to use a small/partial onion or leave it out.
- For stock, vegetable or chicken is probably preferable.
- The amount or intensity of your stock does not matter much.
- The amount of butter and parmesan depend on how rich you want your risotto.
- The amount of wine really does not matter (could leave it out or triple).
- You probably want a dry white wine, but any white wine or vermouth will work.
- If you run out of stock and your risotto is still hard, use water instead.
- If your risotto is already soft and you have stock left over, just leave it out.
- If your risotto is already soft but still very wet, let the water evaporate on medium heat.
- The process is much quicker and controllable if you use hot stock / water.
